WordRecall
==========

An app I made to help me study SAT vocab words.

I made a list of vocab words from Direct Hits and used the unofficial Google dictionary API to get definitions. The app uses a spaced repition algorithm to test words. Ex: If you get a word right once, you will be tested 6 hours later, if you get it right twice, 24 hours later, get it right 3 times, 5 day laters.
